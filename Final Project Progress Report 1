CS 485 Final Project Progress Report (1) 
Objective: 
Finish a complete design document with details for your game. To provide an update of your project thus far, and where you are in your planned schedule. 
Submission: 
Turn in your design document and progress report on cougar courses and a printed copy in class. This is a group assignment, so each group only needs to submit one copy. 
Description: 

1. Design Document (70%) 
The Design document (8-10 pages) should a fairly detailed plan from which you could build the game. It should describe the game world, the feature set, game characters, user interface, weapons, sound effects, etc. See the attached “Design Document” by Ernest W. Adams for further discussion. 
Note that not all sections may be applicable to your game, and the length that is being requested is shorter than what would be expected in industry. So you will have to use your own judgment regarding how to make best use of the 8-10 pages that you are allotted for this. Your design document can include sketches and level designs, but be sure not include so many figures that you do not have enough space for your text descriptions. 

2. Progress Update (20%) 
Provide a brief time-line update of your progress so far and what remains to be done, with contributions from each group member. This should be about 1-2 pages, with some screenshots if applicable. 

3. In-class Presentation (10%) 
Each group will present its design document and progress on the due date. You should discuss some details of game design and current progress. Although it is not required, you can also show a demo of your project if you have one working.
