Design History

	Life Of A Gamer began as a game programing project for the computer science 485 level class. 
	The team members begain brainstorming this game on late February of 2014. 
	All team member wanted to bring commedy/fun to our game. 
	This is a brief explanation of the history of this document.

	In this paragraph describe to the reader what you are trying to achieve with the design history.  It is possible that they don’t know what this is for and you need to explain it to them.

Version 1.10

	Version 1.10 includes some tuning and tweaking that I did after making my initial pass at the design.  Here is what I changed.

1.	I rewrote the section about what systems the game runs on.
2.	I incorporated feedback from the team into all parts of the design however no major changes were made.
3.	Just keep listing your changes like this.

Version 2.00

	Version 2.00 is the first version of the design where a major revision has been made now that much more is known about the game.  After many hours of design, many decisions have been made.  Most of these large design decisions are now reflected in this document.

	Included in the changes are:

1.	Pairing down of the design scope. (Scope, not design)
2.	More detailed descriptions in many areas, specifically A, B and C.
3.	Story details.
4.	World layout and design.

Version 2.10

	Version 2.10 has several small changes over that of version 2.00.  The key areas are in many of the appendixes.

	Included in the changes are:

1.	Minor revisions throughout entire document.
2.	Added “User Interface Appendix”.
3.	Added “Game Object Properties Appendix”.
4.	Added concept sketch for world.
 

Game Overview

Philosophy

Philosophical point #1
//This game is trying to do this and that.  Fundamentally I am trying to achieve something that has never been achieved before.  Or.  This game will not try and change the world.  We are ripping off the competition so exactly that I can’t believe it.  The world will be shocked at how we are using an existing engine with new art.
This game is trying to take a basic "templet" and see how drasticly this templet will play with the addition of
one new power.
Philosophical point #2
//Our game only runs on Compaq computers.  The reason for this is such and such.  We believe the world is coming to and end anyhow so what difference does it make?
This game should be easy to figure out how to play despite new powers being constatnly introduced to the player

//Philosophical point #3
//When you create some of these overarching philosophical points about your design, say whatever you want.  Also, feel free to change it to “My game design goals” or whatever you like to call it.

Common Questions

What is the game?

//Describe the game is a paragraph.  This is the answer to the most common question that you will be asked.  What are you working on?
What our game is: This game is a 3-d platformer that guides our hero through
various video game inspired levels, he has a basic set of platforming abilites that
he keeps throughout the whole game (double jumping, running, etc.) as well as one or two more "exotic" 
abilites that is unique for only the level that he is on. 

Why create this game?

//Why are you creating this game?  Do you love 3D shooters?  Do you think there is a hole in the market for Jell-O tossing midgets?
Why did we create this game: We couldn't pick just one gameplay mechanic to base this game around
so we originally intended to make a "variety game" that had a small main game and a bunch of mini-games that
could be played with it, sort of like the game Kirby Superstar Ultra, but we decided just to make the whole
game one genere (3D Platformer) and give the character different abilities to use each level.

Where does the game take place?

//Describe the world that your game takes place in.  Simple as that.  Help frame it in the reader’s mind by spending a few sentences on it here.  You can go into lengthy detail later in a section solely dedicated to describing the world.  Remember that we want to keep this part of the design light and readable.
Our Game's Setting: The actual game play takes place in the imagination of our main character
there will be small cut scenes in between levels taking place in real life, going through our character's
real world daily routine.

What do I control?

//Describe what the player will control.  You will be in charge of a band of rabid mutant fiddle players.  If you want you can switch on the AI and turn it into a fish bowl simulation.
Our game's controllable character: You will be controlling Jems as he imagines himself as his favorite
game characters, his "unique" abilites depend on what character he is imagining himself as.

//How many characters do I control?
Jems is the only playable character.

//If this applies talk a little more about the control choices.  Remember to add answers to questions that you think the reader will ask.  This is totally dependent on your design.
 Don't think this is needed for our game



What is the main focus?

	//Now that we know where the game takes place and what the player controls.  What are they supposed to achieve in this world?  Angry fiddle players take over the U.N. building.  Be careful not to add a bunch of salesmanship here.  Your design wants to stay light and informative.
The focus of this game: Tight,responsive character controls, good camera and a variety of interesting abilities
for this character to use.

What’s different?

//Tell them what is different from the games that are attempting this in the market right now.  This question comes up a lot.
Difference from the competition: There are not many 3D platformers coming out these days so there is not much
competetion coming from the exact same genere, as for 2D platformers that may provide competition, the Kirby games 
have a similiar concept of a character that game get new abilities. In the Kirby games the main character gets his
abilites temporarily from enemies, the leveles are rarely designed around these temporary abilities, in our game 
the main character is given his abilitis from the start of the level so we can design levels around our unique ablities.

The Game World

Overview

//Provide an overview to the game world.
There are 2 different "worlds" in this game a real-life world and the imaginairy worlds in the main character's head.
//World Feature #1
//This section is not supposed to be called world feature #1 but is supposed to be titled with some major thing about the world.  This is where you break down what is so great about the game world into component pieces and describe each one.
The Real World
This is modern day Earth in a typical city following the typical routein of a typical kid, used as transtitions into
the main levels of this game which take place in......
//World Feature #2
//Same thing here.  Don’t sell too hard.  These features should be awesome and be selling the game on its own.
The Imaginiary Worlds
These are imaginiary worlds that our hero dreams up while bored/distracted there are several different worlds that
he "goes" to and each one is inspired from a different video game he's been playing recently. He explores there worlds
with a special ablility that the actual hero of that game world uses in that game, for example if he'smight have a blaster
like samus/mega-man as his ability for one levle while he might be able to drop/kick bombs like bomberman in another level,
the levels and enemies and puzzles found in the level will be balanced around whatever his ability for that level is.


Overview

//Describe an overview of the physical world.  Then start talking about the components of the physical world below in each paragraph.
There are 2 different worlds seen in this game, there is the real life world seen in the small cutscenes
that show Jems going through a fairly normal daily routien for a middle/grade schooler and Jems imaginiary,
video game inspired worlds where the majority of the gameplay happens.

The following describes the key components of the physical world.

Key Locations

//Describe the key locations in the world here.
In the real world:
-Jems house: Where he and his mom live, the game starts here with Jems waking up and getting ready to leave for school.
-The School: Jems school where he often get bored and starts daydreaming about being in video games.
-The Car: Jems mom ferries him to and from school, Jems often spends trips in here visiting his pretend worlds.
-Jems head: Where most of this game's actions takes place, home to many fantastical worlds.

Travel

In the real world his mom is his main form of transportation, in Jems game worlds he usually run and jumps
through the levels using his powers to get through the levels.

Scale

//Describe the scale that you will use to represent the world.  Scale is important!	
Levels are farily large and linear.

Objects

Describe the different objects that can be found in the world.

Camera

Overview

Describe the way the camera will work and then go into details if the camera is very complicated in sub sections.

Camera Detail #1
//The camera will move around like this and that.
Being a 3D platformer, the camera controls are very important to get right. The camera will follow the player in a 
standard third person format, with it locking when the player jumps to avoidconfusing angles while moving in mid-air, 
it will be looking "down"  on the player at an angle generally trying to followform behind. 
The exception to this is if the player turns directly twoards the camera, instead of instantly moving 180
degrees to follow it will move slowly behind. The camera is zoomed out a fair amount to give the player a good look at 
his surroundings and to make movement easier when he moves twoards the camera.

//Camera Detail #2

//The camera will sometimes move like this in this special circumstance.

Game Engine

Overview
//Describe the game engine in general.

Game Engine Detail #1

	The game engine will keep track of everything in the world like such and such.

Water

Water in this game will have a stylized look.
Collision Detection
//Our game engine handles collision detection really well.  It uses the such and such technique and will be quite excellent.  Can you see I am having a hard time making up stupid placeholder text here?
Standard collision detection, using the built-in rigidbodies and colliders as triggers.

Enemies and Monsters
//Describe enemies or monsters in the world or whomever the player is trying to defeat.  Naturally this depends heavily on your game idea but generally games are about trying to kill something.

"boring" everyday life in between his dream levels
Single Player Game Detail #2
Each level with grant him a special ablility to use for that level and that level only, he will need to use this 
ability alongside his standard plaforming moves to manuver through the levels and make it to the end.
Story

//Describe your story idea here and then refer them to an appendix or separate document which provides all the details on the story if it is really big.

Extra Miscellaneous Stuff

Overview

Drop anything you are working on and don’t have a good home for here.

Junk I am working on…

Crazy idea #1

Crazy idea #2

 

 “XYZ Appendix”

	Provide a brief description of what this appendix is for and then get down to business and provide data to the reader.

	Here are a few examples of some of the appendices in my latest design…

 “Objects Appendix”

“User Interface Appendix”

 “Networking Appendix”

“Character Rendering and Animation Appendix”

 “Story Appendix”

	Okay, that’s it.  I wanted to spend more time on this and really make it a great roadmap for putting a game design together.  Unfortunately it would take a ton of time and that is something that we don’t have enough of in this business.  I think you get the idea anyhow.  Also, don’t get the impression that I think a design should provide the information in any particular order, this just happened to be the way it fell out of my head when I sat down.  Change this template any way you want and if you feel you have improved on it, send it back to me and I can pass it out as an alternative to anyone that asks me in the future.

	Good luck and all that!

	Chris Taylor
